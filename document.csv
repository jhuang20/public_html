<br><b>Dylan Mak </b>, dmak1@stuy. edu , Hello, Thank you so much for all your hard work. I’m super excited for this! Would it be possible for me to apply in advance for the next session, as I’m out of town the 27th? I’m happy to supply the info in the survey. (I didn’t fill it out because I don’t want to take a spot away from someone who could be present.) Thanks! Dylan Mak <br>
