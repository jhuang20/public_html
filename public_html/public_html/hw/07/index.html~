<h1>How I Uploaded This All</h1>
<h2>First Steps</h2>
One of the first things I did was consolidate all the hw assignments and folders into one folder. Then I made the homepage.html documents and linked it to all the other homeworks. I also added a link to the homepage from all html Homeworks! One can seamlessly navigate through all the folders and homeworks from the homepage!

<h2>Uploading All of This</h2>
I downloaded FileZilla and connected to clyde.stuy.edu under my username. Then I uploaded the public_html folder that I created, and then just tried out the website. It worked!!!
