208762559, Suzuki , Joe,joesuzuki516@gmail.com,2001-05-16,Frontend: I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, javascript and react for frontend design and have used those technologies to create fast serving sites. I have made projects to handle multiple navigations faster and prettier, so that that the user experience is as high as it can be. Backend: I know how to use several cloud services to store and manipulate data. I am also comfortable with SQL and data parsing. I have general knowledge of python as a backend (I usually work with node.js), however, I am capable of learning quickly to meet the needs of whatever stack is being used. ,I am a software engineer on Stuy's robotics team. I will be available on weekends and whenever there are no robotics meetings.
