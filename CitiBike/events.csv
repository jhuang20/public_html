2018-08-12,Group Ride #1,12:00,2:00,25,Get hype for our first group ride!(and bring your friends along too) Our first group ride will meet at the Tribeca Bridge_right at the CitiBike station. We will then ride up the Hudson River Greenway to Central Park. As an added bonus_you can use the day passes after the group ride_and enjoy CitiBiking through NYC! This event is limited to 25 people_and does require parental permission through a waiver release form. I cannot let you ride without a release form. The ride will be about 1.5 hours_and we will end at 5th Avenue and 90th Street. Stay tuned for updates!,2
